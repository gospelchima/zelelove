      <h1>For Osezele</h1>
      <p>
        In a world full of billions of people, I will hear you, I will choose
        you, I will love you. Our laughter, from the first time we talked, still
        echoes after 7 years of friendship, Zele. I will choose you over and
        over again.

      <p>
        Hey, baby, itâ€™s a new year for you today, and I'm super grateful to God
        for your life. I appreciate having you by my side forever. A lot has
        happened in this past year, but one thing has remained consistent â€“ the
        love, care, and forgiveness you've shown me. I wouldn't have come this
        far without your fierce love. ðŸ˜­ You've gone above and beyond for my
        sake, Bim, and I'm forever grateful.<br />
        <br />
        I remember the first day we talked at 16-17, and we haven't stopped
        since then. Our marriage is going to be 24-24 to make it equal! ðŸ˜‚
        <br />
        <br />
        You are a kind, lovely, and caring woman, Bim. I've seen you grow
        through the years, fighting through tears with unending joy in your
        heart. In all things, you've maintained a heart posture of love and
        motherly care.<br />
        <br />
        Here are 23 not-so-random things:<br />
        <br />You are honest.<br />
        You have a heart of love. <br />When you're sad, you always want me to
        hold you. <br />Your love for souls and Christ is unconditional.
        <br />You're a strong believer in financial kingdom principles.
        <br />You're a stress-free person; you don't really have wahala.
        <br />You just want a life of love and fellowship with Christ. <br />You
        don't need the world, all the money, or gifts of life to be happy and
        comfortable. <br />You're easy to love and please. <br />You want to
        live a blameless life. You have integrity. You pray a lot. You fast
        passionately. <br />You've shown your peers the way of prayer. <br />You
        are the priest of your home. <br />You love a simple, quiet life
